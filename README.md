### :open_book: Markdown Language {#markdownNov24}

- Markdown is a lightweight language used to define text formatting for display through easy-to-understand syntax. It can be mixed with other languages.
- Markdown is a markup language used to define content formatting. For example, `**` `**` is used to define bold text, and `#` defines a heading level one, etc.
- Markdown is an easy-to-use tool for formatting documents, and it can be integrated with other languages in various ways. For example, in HTML, Markdown can be embedded directly. With CSS, Markdown is first transformed into HTML, allowing it to be styled accordingly.
- Markdown can be transferred and displayed on multiple platforms and tools, such as web browsers, document management systems, document tools, social and chat platforms, CMS, private application, etc.

> **The Importance of Learning**
> Markdown is used in multiple formats, but it is generally intended to organize and display content in a way that is easy to understand and not overly complex.

### :open_book: Git and GitHub {#gitNov2024}

- Git is a version control system that allows you to track code changes in projects. It is useful when collaborating. GitHub is a hosting service for projects that use Git, and it has many features for easier collaboration.
- Git uses the command line to work by writing commands that tell the computer to perform tasks on projects or files.
- GitHub has many features, such as code review tools that allow users to comment on each line of code to share ideas or ask questions, and GitHub Pages, which provides free hosting for static websites.
- GitHub has an interface, which allows us to track code changes or collaborate without using Git commands.

### :open_book: Programming {#programmingNov24}

- Programming is a process of creating a set of commands to instruct a computer to perform tasks. It has four key elements: code, programming languages, algorithms, and logic.
- Code is a set of commands used to instruct a computer to perform tasks such as calculations, organizing data, or displaying information.
- Programming languages are tools used to write code. They include low-level languages, such as Assembly, which are close to the languages that computers understand directly. High-level languages, such as Python, are easy to understand for humans.
- An algorithm is a procedure or process used for solving problems or working efficiently.
- Logic is reasoning and the use of conditions to make decisions, such as using commands like if-else statements or loops.

### :open_book: Front-end development {#frontEndNov24}

- Front-end development is the process of developing the front part of a website or application that users can see and interact with directly. It focuses on designing and creating the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).
- The main duties of front-end development include developing and maintaining the UI/UX, creating responsive designs, improving efficiency, and collaborating with the back-end team.

### :open_book: Internet {#internetNov24}

- The Internet is a large network that connects computers and other devices around the world. It enables data transfer and communication using the TCP/IP protocol, which is essential for communication between devices.
- The Internet is a vast network of networks, consisting of many interconnected networks. It allows users to access all types of data and enables devices to communicate over the Internet.
- The Internet consists of five main elements: hardware, protocols, IP addresses, DNS, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
- Hardware includes devices such as routers, which help transfer data between networks; switches, which connect devices within the same network; and cables, like fiber optic cables, used for data transfer.
- Protocols include the TCP/IP protocol, which is primarily used for data communication on the Internet; HTTP/HTTPS, used for accessing websites; FTP, used for file transfers; and SMTP/IMAP, used for sending and receiving emails.
- An IP address is a unique identifier for each device on the Internet, such as 192.168.1.1.
- DNS is a system that translates domain names, which are human-readable, into IP addresses that computers can understand.
- nternet Service Providers (ISPs) provide internet services to connect users to the internet, with examples such as AIS, True, and TOT.
