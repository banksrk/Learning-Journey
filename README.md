### :open_book: Markdown Language

- Markdown is a lightweight language used to define text formatting for display through easy-to-understand syntax. It can be mixed with other languages.
- Markdown is a markup language used to define content formatting. For example, `**` `**` is used to define bold text, and `#` defines a heading level one, etc.
- Markdown is an easy-to-use tool for formatting documents, and it can be integrated with other languages in various ways. For example, in HTML, Markdown can be embedded directly. With CSS, Markdown is first transformed into HTML, allowing it to be styled accordingly.
- Markdown can be transferred and displayed on multiple platforms and tools, such as web browsers, document management systems, document tools, social and chat platforms, CMS, private application, etc.

> **The Importance of Learning**
> Markdown is used in multiple formats, but it is generally intended to organize and display content in a way that is easy to understand and not overly complex.

### :open_book: Git and GitHub

- Git is a version control system that allows you to track code changes in projects. It is useful when collaborating. GitHub is a hosting service for projects that use Git, and it has many features for easier collaboration.
- Git uses the command line to work by writing commands that tell the computer to perform tasks on projects or files.
- GitHub has many features, such as code review tools that allow users to comment on each line of code to share ideas or ask questions, and GitHub Pages, which provides free hosting for static websites.
- GitHub has an interface, which allows us to track code changes or collaborate without using Git commands.

### :open_book: Programming

- Programming is a process of creating a set of commands to instruct a computer to perform tasks. It has four key elements: code, programming languages, algorithms, and logic.
- Code is a set of commands used to instruct a computer to perform tasks such as calculations, organizing data, or displaying information.
- Programming languages are tools used to write code. They include low-level languages, such as Assembly, which are close to the languages that computers understand directly. High-level languages, such as Python, are easy to understand for humans.
- An algorithm is a procedure or process used for solving problems or working efficiently.
- Logic is reasoning and the use of conditions to make decisions, such as using commands like if-else statements or loops.

### :open_book: Front-end development

- Front-end development is the process of developing the front part of a website or application that users can see and interact with directly. It focuses on designing and creating the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).
- The main duties of front-end development include developing and maintaining the UI/UX, creating responsive designs, improving efficiency, and collaborating with the back-end team.

### :open_book: Internet

- The Internet is a large network that connects computers and other devices around the world. It enables data transfer and communication using the TCP/IP protocol, which is essential for communication between devices.
- The Internet is a vast network of networks, consisting of many interconnected networks. It allows users to access all types of data and enables devices to communicate over the Internet.
- The Internet consists of five main elements: hardware, protocols, IP addresses, DNS, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
- Hardware includes devices such as routers, which help transfer data between networks; switches, which connect devices within the same network; and cables, like fiber optic cables, used for data transfer.
- Protocols include the TCP/IP protocol, which is primarily used for data communication on the Internet; HTTP/HTTPS, used for accessing websites; FTP, used for file transfers; and SMTP/IMAP, used for sending and receiving emails.
- An IP address is a unique identifier for each device on the Internet, such as 192.168.1.1.
- DNS is a system that translates domain names, which are human-readable, into IP addresses that computers can understand.
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide internet services to connect users to the internet, with examples such as AIS, True, and TOT.

### :open_book: Browser and Server

- Browser is software that use access and display data on internet such as website, video, document work by pass protocol HTTP/HTTPS. Server is computer or systems at service data or srouce by internet network.
- The main duties of a browser include converting URLs into requests based on user input, retrieving content data from the server, and displaying the data to the user.
- The main duties of a server include receiving requests from the browser, processing those requests, and sending data back to the browser.

> **The Importance of Learning**
> A browser is a client that requests data from a server. The server receives the request, processes it, and sends the data back to the browser for display.

### :open_book: Text Editor and Code Editor

- A text editor is a program used for editing plain text, such as documents, with examples including Notepad. A code editor is a specialized program designed for editing code, with examples like VS Code.
- Text Editors and Code Editors are analogous but have different purposes, each with its own pros and cons. For example, Code Editors offer many features and extensions, including syntax highlighting to differentiate various elements of code, making them suitable for programming. On the other hand, Text Editors provide basic functionalities like changing font color and size. They consume very little system resources, making them more appropriate for simple tasks like editing plain text documents.

### :open_book: Web Hosting

- Web hosting is a service that allows websites or applications to be online and accessible via the Internet. Web hosting services allocate space on a server to store files and data necessary for the website's operation. 
- Web hosting has four elements: the server, which is a computer that provides 24-hour services to support website access for users; storage, which is an area for storing files used on the website; bandwidth, which is the amount of data that can be transferred between the server and the user at one point in time; and DNS, which transfers the domain to an IP address.
- Web hosting has many types, such as shared hosting, where various websites share resources on the same server; VPN hosting, which splits the server into smaller sections that work separately, like a private server; dedicated hosting, where all the resources of the server are used exclusively for one website; cloud hosting, where multiple servers in a network collaborate to provide services; managed hosting, where services such as software updates, item reservation, and server maintenance are handled; and free hosting, which is a free hosting service often with limitations on data storage, bandwidth, and ads

### :open_book: Command Line

- The command line is an interface used to interact with a computer by writing commands in text format, supported by programs such as Terminal or Command Prompt.   
- Commands have properties such as allowing the user to type instructions for the computer to perform tasks, such as opening files, deleting files, etc. Using the command line helps to perform tasks faster and more efficiently than a GUI, especially for tasks like organizing a large number of files. Commands are flexible because they can be combined to perform multiple tasks with one command, such as using the `|` operator to connect various commands together.
- Command line syntax differs across different operating systems, though some commands have the same syntax. For example, to change directories, Windows uses `cd`, and macOS/Linux also uses `cd`. To show the directory contents, Windows uses `dir`, while macOS/Linux uses `ls`, and so on.

> **The Importance of Learning**
> The command line is used to give commands to a computer to perform tasks. It is fast and efficient for performing multiple tasks in a single line of code.
